Hashing Algorithms in python

This is my first python project which I have completed during my 7 Days Bootcamp on Python and Network Security by ShapeAI. In this project, I have created a hashing algorithm using the hashlib library in python in which I have created,

1. a program in python to generate the md5 hashed output of the string data given by the user.

2. a program in python to generate hashes of string data using 3 algorithms from the hashlib(sha256, sha512, sha224).

3. At last added salting and iterations to my hashes.
